I am a postdoctoral researcher at Division of Decision and Control Systems, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, supervised by [Prof. Karl Henrik Johansson](https://people.kth.se/~kallej/index.html). I received my B.S. degree in psychology from Peking University in 2014, and my Ph.D. degree in operations research and control theory in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Haitao Fang](http://lsc.amss.ac.cn/~htfang/index.html), from Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests include social networks (social opinion dynamics, network inference, community detection, etc), system identification, and stochastic approximation algorithms.
