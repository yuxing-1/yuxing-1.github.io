I have broad research interests in dynamics and algorithms over networks. Below are some major projects I have been working on.

## 1. Quantifying Emergent Behaviors in Network Dynamics

## 2. Learning Network Structure from Dynamical Observations

## 3. Analyzing Stochastic Approximation and System Identification Algorithms
